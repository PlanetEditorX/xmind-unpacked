<h2 id="-software-license-statement-"><strong>Software License Statement</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><strong>License Authorization:</strong> We only provide you with a license to use the Software and do not sell
      you the ownership of the Software; after you agree to all terms, we will grant you the right to use the Software
      on the current computer or mobile devices through a license. If the license period expires or is terminated, the
      Customer may not be able to use the Xmind Software before renewing the license.</li>
   <li>
      <p><strong>License Types</strong></p>
      <ol type="A">
         <li><p><strong>Trial Version Software:</strong> If the Xmind Software or any part thereof is provided with a
            serial number or other similar wording indicating “for evaluation purposes only” (e.g., “Trial Mode”,
            “Evaluation Mode”), it may only be installed and used for demonstration and evaluation purposes on the
            authorized number of computers or mobile devices during the license period. <strong>Any output files or
               other materials generated by such use may only be used for the functionality or evaluation of the
               Software and may not be used for any other purpose.</strong> The Customer agrees that Xmind may change
            the restrictions on the trial version and stop supporting the trial version software and any output files
            created by the trial version at any time without any liability to the Customer for such changes. The risk of
            accessing and using any output files created by such trial version software is entirely borne by the
            Customer.</p></li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Subscription Version Software:</strong> The Customer, by purchasing an individual or team
               subscription to the Xmind Software on the official website or authorized third-party websites, may only
               use the individual or team subscription version on computers or mobile devices during the license period,
               according to the purchased subscription plan.</p>
            <p> Subscription versions include individual and team subscriptions, with different subscription plans
               possibly including different features, services, and management tools, the specific features and services
               being subject to the subscription plan purchased.</p>
            <p> The Customer needs to connect to the Internet to activate, update, and verify the license. <strong>If
                  Xmind is unable to verify regularly, the Software may cease to function without further
                  notice;</strong> the Customer agrees that Xmind may change the type of software included in the
               subscription version (e.g., related features, components, versions, platforms, languages, etc.) at any
               time without any liability to the Customer for such changes.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Small and Medium-Sized Business Version Software:</strong> The Customer, by purchasing the Xmind Software for

               only use the Small and Medium-Sized Business version within the enterprise according to the purchased
               authorized number of computers. The Xmind Software will prioritize attempts to activate and periodically
               verify the Customer’s license via the Internet. <strong>If the Internet verification identifies an
                  invalid license, the Software may cease to function without further notice;</strong> the Customer
               agrees that Xmind may change the type of software included in the Small and Medium-Sized Business version
               (e.g., related features, components, versions, platforms, languages, etc.) at any time without any
               liability to the Customer for such changes.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p><strong>Enterprise Version Software:</strong> The Customer, by purchasing the Xmind Software Enterprise
            Version on the official website or authorized third-party websites, may only use the Enterprise Version
            within the enterprise. The Customer agrees that Xmind may change the type of software included in the
            Enterprise Version (e.g., related features, components, versions, platforms, languages, etc.) at any time
            without any liability to the Customer for such changes.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Free Version Software:</strong> Xmind provides a free version of its software for download and use.
            Users may use the corresponding free features on authorized computers or mobile devices within the free

            included in the free version (e.g., related features, components, versions, platforms, languages, etc.) at
            any time without any liability to the Customer for such changes.</p></li>
      </ol>
   </li>

      and desktops with the recommended operating system and hardware configuration for Xmind Software.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Mobile Device:</strong> The term “mobile device” as used in this agreement refers to smartphones,

</ol>
<h2 id="-xmind-account-"><strong>Xmind Account</strong></h2>
<p>Some services of Xmind Software (e.g., activating Xmind subscriptions, Xmind file sharing, team collaboration, using
   AI features, etc.) require an Xmind account. You may choose to create an Xmind account directly or register for an
   Xmind account through a third-party account (including but not limited to Apple ID and Google account) to log in and
   use Xmind Software.</p>
<p><strong>Whether logging in with an Xmind account or a third-party account, your Xmind account is highly valuable. You
      are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security and for all activities that occur under your
      account or through your account. You agree to immediately notify Xmind of any security vulnerabilities associated
      with your account.</strong></p>
<p>For personal use of an Xmind account, you further acknowledge and agree that the account is for personal use only and
   that you may not share your account and/or password details with others. For team subscriptions, team administrators
   have the right to manage team members&#39; account permissions and are responsible for ensuring the security of
   accounts and the appropriateness of information sharing within the team. Team administrators should ensure that only
   authorized users can access collaboration content and are responsible for all activities within the team.</p>
<p>Under conditions where we have applied reasonable skill and exercised appropriate due diligence, Xmind shall not be
   liable for any loss resulting from the unauthorized use of your account due to your or your team’s failure to comply
   with these rules.</p>
<p>You agree to provide accurate and complete information when registering for Xmind and to update your registration
   information to keep it accurate and complete. <strong>Failure to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date
      registration information may result in the suspension and/or termination of your account.</strong> You agree that
   Xmind may store and use the registration information you provide to maintain your account.</p>
<p>Enterprise customers may use a serial number to activate the Xmind Software for Small and Medium-Sized Business
   Version or directly use a custom-authorized Enterprise Version installation package instead of an Xmind account.
   <strong>You are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security and may not share the serial number or
      the Enterprise Version installation package outside the enterprise.</strong></p>
<h2 id="-ai-capabilities-"><strong>AI Capabilities</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>The AI-related capabilities provided in the application (hereinafter referred to as “Copilot”) are based on
      third-party artificial intelligence services (e.g., OpenAI). Xmind itself does not have large model training
      capabilities, so all AI-generated content is produced by these third-party services. By using Copilot, you agree
      to comply with the policies and terms of use of the relevant third party.</p></li>
   <li><p>You may provide input content to Copilot (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Input&quot;) and receive output
      content generated and returned by Copilot based on that Input (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Output&quot;).
      Both the Input and Output are user content, and you retain all rights to them. Xmind reserves all rights to its
      platform and its improvements, enhancements, new products, and features.</p></li>
   <li><p>You may not use the Copilot function or Output content for any illegal activity or in violation of any applicable
      technical documentation, user guidelines, or parameters. Specifically, you may not use AI-generated content to
      mislead others into believing that this content is entirely human-generated, to generate spam, or to engage in
      political campaigns.</p></li>
   <li><p>Xmind makes no guarantee of the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated content. You should
      independently assess the accuracy and applicability of such content and bear full responsibility for its use.
      Xmind is not responsible for any omissions or errors resulting from the use of AI-generated content.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-collaboration-capabilities-"><strong>Collaboration Capabilities</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>Collaboration refers to the ability for users to save and host files on Xmind’s servers, share files through
      Xmind’s servers, or collaboratively view and edit files with other users. Users can also create teams, invite
      members to join the team, manage team files, and collaboratively view and edit files among team members.</p></li>
   <li><p>When using the collaboration feature, users must ensure that the content uploaded complies with the provisions of
      this agreement and applicable laws. Users may not upload, store, or share any content that may infringe on the
      rights of others or violate the law. Xmind is not responsible for the content uploaded by users, and users are
      responsible for the legality and applicability of the content.</p></li>
   <li><p>Team administrators have the right to manage team members’ account permissions and are responsible for ensuring
      the security of accounts and the appropriateness of information sharing within the team. Team administrators
      should ensure that only authorized users can access collaboration content and are responsible for all activities
      within the team.</p></li>
   <li><p>Xmind will take reasonable technical measures to protect the security of files hosted on its servers by users.
      However, users are responsible for backing up important files themselves, and Xmind is not liable for any file
      loss or disclosure caused by force majeure or third-party reasons.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-public-beta-version-"><strong>Public Beta Version</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>Xmind Software may choose to provide new and/or updated features of the service (“Beta Features”) as part of a
      public beta program (“Program”) to provide feedback to Xmind on the quality and usability of the Beta Features.
      You understand and agree that your participation in the Program is voluntary, does not create a legal partnership,
      agency, or employment relationship between you and Xmind, and that Xmind is not obligated to provide you with any
      Beta Features. Xmind may make such Beta Features available to Program participants through online registration,
      download, or solicitation.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Beta features may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause malfunctions, crashes, or loss of data
         on your files or computer. You explicitly acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks associated with the
         use of Beta Features.</strong></p></li>
   <li><p>Xmind may or may not provide technical and/or other support for Beta Features. Xmind reserves the right to modify
      the terms, conditions, or policies of the Program (including terminating the Program) at any time, with or without
      notice, and may withdraw your participation in the Program at any time.</p></li>
   <li><p>You acknowledge that Xmind is under no obligation to provide commercial versions of Beta Features. As part of the
      Program, Xmind will provide you with opportunities to submit opinions, suggestions, or other feedback on the use
      of Beta Features. You agree that, unless otherwise signed in a separate written agreement to the contrary, Xmind
      may freely use any feedback you provide for any purpose.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-updates-"><strong>Updates</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>To enhance the user experience and improve the functionality and performance of Xmind Software, Xmind will
      continuously strive to develop new features and provide software updates to customers on an irregular basis.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Xmind Software may automatically detect and prompt customers to install updates. By using Xmind Software,
         the customer agrees that Xmind has the right to update the software, and to modify or restrict certain features
         of the software.</strong></p></li>
   <li><p>Upon the release of a new version of Xmind Software, prior versions may no longer be usable. Xmind makes no
      warranty regarding the continued availability or support of prior versions, and customers are advised to regularly
      verify and download the latest version.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-usage-data-collection-"><strong>Usage Data Collection</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>If the Customer consents to Xmind Software collecting usage data, the Customer agrees that Xmind may collect,
      maintain, process, and use relevant information (including but not limited to computer, system, and Xmind Software
      version information, commonly used features of Xmind Software, license types, software crashes, and error
      messages) to provide and improve Xmind’s products and services, provide software updates, product support, and
      other possible services related to Xmind Software.</p></li>
   <li>
      <p>The Customer&#39;s usage data will be encrypted and sent to Xmind&#39;s server. The account passwords for
         third-party accounts (such as Evernote and Biggerplate) bound in Xmind Software will not be stored locally by
         Xmind Software or uploaded to Xmind&#39;s server.</p>
      <p> You can turn off the automatic sending of usage data at any time by unchecking “Preferences &gt; Share
         Analytics.” The Small and Medium-Sized Business Version and the Enterprise Version will not automatically
         collect usage data and do not offer relevant settings.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>When using Xmind Software&#39;s collaboration or sharing features, certain functions (such as generating share
         links or sharing to third-party social platforms) require uploading your files to Xmind&#39;s servers for
         proper functionality. Xmind assures you that it will not collect, store, or share any account passwords or
         related information from the third-party social platforms linked through your files.</p>
   </li>
   <li><p>Xmind Software utilizes a specialized encryption method for encrypted output files. The customer acknowledges and
      understands that Xmind cannot provide decryption, password recovery, or similar services. You are solely
      responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your encrypted files and assume full
      responsibility for all actions involving them. Xmind shall not be liable for any loss resulting from issues such
      as corrupted encrypted files or forgotten passwords.</p></li>
   <li><p>Xmind will not use your content for training machine learning models. Your use of the Copilot feature does not
      grant Xmind any rights or licenses to your content for model training. All data processing will strictly adhere to
      our privacy policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-customer-feedback-"><strong>Customer Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>The Customer is under no obligation to provide suggestions or feedback to Xmind. <strong>If the Customer chooses to
      submit feedback to Xmind, the submission of such feedback shall be without charge and shall constitute a grant to
      Xmind of a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, and unrestricted worldwide license to utilize and exploit the
      feedback for any purpose.</strong> The Customer shall ensure that the feedback does not contain any confidential
   or proprietary information belonging to the Customer or any third party.</p>
<h2 id="-third-party-software-and-technology-"><strong>Third-Party Software and Technology</strong></h2>
<ol>
   <li><p>Xmind Software may use third-party software or technology (such as open-source development frameworks and public
      plugins), and such use has been legally authorized.</p></li>
   <li><p><strong>Any disputes arising from third-party software or technology used in Xmind Software shall be resolved by
         the third party. Xmind makes no guarantees and assumes no direct or indirect liability for any open-source
         materials included in Xmind Software.</strong></p></li>
